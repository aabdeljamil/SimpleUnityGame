Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge solution:

$git fetch origin  # fetch remote commits
$git checkout -f origin/master  # replace FOI with tracked upstream versions
$git checkout master# FOI are not in mybranch, so they disapppear
$git merge origin/master  # Now the merge works. fetch + merge completes the pull.
